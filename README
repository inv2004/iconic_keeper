1) Version: >= KDB+ 3.6 2018.06.14
2) Download json into this folder
```
wget "http://94.130.33.186:8888/x/full-log.json.gz"
```
3) Import json into kdb format
```
q import.q
```
hist folder contais hdb
rdb.dat contains last date (it could be extracted by .z.d (today) date)

4) Start stack
```
run.sh
```
it will run hdb, rdb and gw processes:
gw listens 5000 port, rdb - 6000, hdb - 6010

I applied last functionality of the 3.6 (Deferred response: -30! function) for async requests.

The only function implemented is: lastNOrders:{[clientIDs;dates;n]

5) Example of usage:
```
q
q)h:hopen 5000
q)h(`lastNOrders;964486 2233991 2233991;2018.07.06,.z.d;2)
```

We did not have any framework to propagate functions from hdb/rdb to gw, thats why I defined its manually in rdb/hdb/gw.
